## 📝 Add Credentials to Your Project

### Option 1: Using .env File (Recommended)

Open your `.env` file at: `c:\Users\adity\Desktop\satellite\.env`

Add these lines (replace with your actual values from the JSON file):

```bash
# Google Earth Engine Credentials
GEE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
GEE_CLIENT_EMAIL=satwatch-earth-engine@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GEE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQC...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**How to get these values from the JSON file:**

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "← Copy this to GEE_PROJECT_ID",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "← Copy this to GEE_PRIVATE_KEY (keep the \n characters!)",
  "client_email": "← Copy this to GEE_CLIENT_EMAIL",
  ...
}
```

**Important for GEE_PRIVATE_KEY:**
- Keep the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
- Replace actual newlines with `\n` (backslash-n)
- It should be one long line with `\n` in it

### Option 2: I'll Help You

If the above seems confusing:
1. Download the JSON file
2. Tell me: **"I have the JSON file"**
3. I'll extract the values and format them for you

## 🔧 What I'll Do Once You Add Credentials

### Immediate Changes (I'll make these automatically):

1. **Update `src/api.py`** to use Earth Engine:
```python
# Import Earth Engine functions
from earth_engine import initialize_earth_engine, get_timeline_images

# Initialize on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    initialize_earth_engine()

# Update timeline endpoint to use real imagery
@app.get("/timeline/{lat}/{lon}")
async def get_timeline(lat: float, lon: float):
    timeline = get_timeline_images(lat, lon)
    return {"status": "success", "source": "Google Earth Engine", "timeline": timeline}
```

2. **Test the connection**:
```python
# I'll add a test endpoint
@app.get("/test-earth-engine")
async def test_earth_engine():
    # Test if credentials work
    # Return sample image from Earth Engine
```

3. **Update frontend** to display real imagery

### "Module 'ee' not found"
```bash
pip install earthengine-api
```

## 💡 Quick Test

Want to see if Earth Engine works before full setup?

I can create a **test script** that:
1. Uses your credentials
2. Fetches one satellite image
3. Shows you it works
4. Takes 2 minutes

Just say: **"Create test script"**

---
